Project description:

    Initial plan is to make program that reads sign language signs with camera and translates those to text.

    First version of the program can read one sign, if possible later more. 


    Product:
        output to led screen  ( few row screen )
        input from video camera ( pictures first )
        button for picture capture (later start of video regognition? )
        power button ( optional )
        program 
        

Specs:
    - Discussion is to be made from where the "learning material" is coming from (licenses etc.)
        - Are we using own data/pictures or from some other source

    - "product" should be in small package which is easily used and transported (rasberry pii).

    - Product programming language is chosen to be python. This can be changed later if needed.


++Possible 

        Both direction communication
            + screen for picture/video output
            + Chatgpt support
            + bluetooht support
            + Text to speech output?
